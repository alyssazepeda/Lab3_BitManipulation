 *	Exercise Description:  Read an 8-bit value on PA7..PA0 and write 
 *	that value on PB3..PB0PC7..PC4. That is to say,  take the upper 
 *	nibble of PINA and map it to the lower nibble of PORTB, likewise 
 *	take the lower nibble of PINA and map it to the upper nibble of 
 *	PORTC (PA7 -> PB3, PA6 -> PB2, â€¦ PA1 -> PC5, PA0 -> PC4).
